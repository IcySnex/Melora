  How it works
</h3>

Melora serves as the frontend for a variety of supported plugins, making it highly expandable and adaptable to your needs. Simply open the **Plugin Bundles** page and import your preferred plugins to enhance your experience.

Currently, **Platform-Support** Plugins ensure compatibility with all your favorite platforms, while **Metadata** Plugins give you the freedom to customize how metadata — *such as titles, artists, lyrics, and everything else* — is written to your tracks.

Looking ahead, Melora plans to support even more types of plugins, including those for syncing with other libraries like iTunes and more.
