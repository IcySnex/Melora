## Automatic Updates
By default, Melora automatically checks for updates and notifies you at startup with all the information if a new update is available, keeping you current with the latest features and bug fixes.

However, if you're the type of person who **hates** automatic updates, you can easily turn off this feature. Simply go to the **Settings** page, expand the "Updates" section, and toggle off the "Automatic Update Check" switch.

## Beta/Alpha Updates and Custom Releases
If you're an adventurous person, enjoying being on the cutting edge and want to get updates before **anyone** else, you can switch to the **Beta** or even **Alpha** update channel. To do this, navigate to the **Settings** page, expand the "Updates" section, and select your preferred update "Channel."

Keep in mind that pre-releases may contain significant bugs. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IcySnex/Melora/issues) page.

For those running a fork of Melora, you can easily use Meloras update infrastructure for your own project by changing the "Releases URL" to your own project or even API *- if you're brave enough to build one*. For more details on how a custom API must be setup, check out the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases) on releases.
