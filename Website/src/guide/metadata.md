We believe your tracks should be **personal** to you! That's why metadata writing with Melora is **highly** customizable. All metadata handling is managed by plugins, giving you full control over how your tracks are labeled and organized.

If you haven’t installed any plugins yet, please refer to the [Plugins Guide](/Melora/guide/plugins.html) to get started.


## Selecting A Metadata-Plugin
You can easily switch between different Metadata plugins, making it easy to organize your music. To choose a plugin for handling track metadata, navigate to the Melora **Settings** page. Under the "**Metadata**" category, select your preferred plugin.

## Configuring A Metadata-Plugin
Each Metadata Plugin in Melora can be **individually** configured, allowing you to edit settings for each source. For example, you might want to download tracks with metadata specifically made for iTunes.

To configure a plugin, go to the Melora **Settings** page and find the "**Metadata**" section. Locate the plugin you want to adjust and expand its options. Unlike Platform-Support Plugins, Metadata Plugins **don't require** any mandatory settings — any available options are specified by the plugin itself.
